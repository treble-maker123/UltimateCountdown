A MacOS app that keeps a list of tasks with a countdown clock. It was created as a result of me not being able to find a free one that works.

#### TODO for V1.0

- Figure out a way to alternate color in NSCollectionViewItem
- Implement "Edit" button on NSCollectionViewItem
- Implement "Close" button on NSCollectionViewItem
- Find a better way to sync all of the countdown clocks. Currently each countdown clock is on a separate Timer

Please reach out to me if you would like to contribute to the project. I could use some UI expertise.
