A MacOS app that keeps a list of tasks with a countdown clock. It was created as a result of me not being able to find a free one that works.


#### TODO for V1.0

- Figure out a way to alternate color in NSCollectionViewItem
- Find a better way to sync all of the countdown clocks. Currently each countdown clock is on a separate Timer
- If the entire test suite is run, a mysterious error is sometimes thrown in CDListViewController where I'm attaching a lambda block to _manager.onItemAdded. No issue when running. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/treble-maker123/UltimateCountdown)


Please reach out to [me](https://www.ziqiangguan.com/contact) if you would like to contribute to the project. I could use some UI expertise.
